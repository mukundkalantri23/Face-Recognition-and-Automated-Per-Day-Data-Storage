# Face-Recognition-and-Automated-Per-Day-Data-Storage
This is a face detection and recognition project which will store a person's images and upon seeing the person again, it would identify the person. Each day a new data file is created and the record of all the people who have been identified by the camera is stored in the file automatically.
Start off by reading the Introduction file and proceed with the instructions given in it.
